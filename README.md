# MATLAB Projects by Hammad

Welcome! 
This repository contains a collection of my MATLAB projects developed during my Master's and current PhD research in Electrical Engineering and Artificial Intelligence at Chulalongkorn University, Thailand.

These projects focus on areas such as:
- Load forecasting using LSTM models
- Battery sizing and energy optimization using metaheuristics
- Power quality analysis (voltage sags, harmonics)
- Simulation and data analysis for industrial energy systems

## Repository Structure

Each folder contains a complete, self-contained project including:
- `.m` files for scripts and functions
- Data files (`.mat`, `.xlsx`, or `.csv`)
- `README.md` explaining each projectâ€™s purpose and usage

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `LoadForecasting_LSTM/` | Time-series load prediction using LSTM (BiLSTM), with preprocessing and model validation |
| `BatterySizingOptimization/` | Optimization of BESS size using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to minimize grid cost |
| `PowerQualityAnalysis/` | Scripts to calculate voltage sags and analyze harmonics in factory distribution systems |

## How to Run the Code

Each project folder includes a `README.md` with instructions.  
Most scripts were developed and tested in **MATLAB R2021a+** with common toolboxes (Deep Learning, Optimization, Signal Processing).
