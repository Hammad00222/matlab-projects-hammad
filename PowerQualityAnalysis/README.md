You can add your data file with "xls" or any format here. This "PowerQualityAnalysis" code runs three tasks: 

- Task 1: Waveform reconstruction from given typical harmonic sources' data. "xls" file should have "Harmonic number" and "Magnitude". 
- Task 2: for task 2, your data file should have three pase current and voltage waveforms having transient at any instant. This task analyzes the harmonics in the given data.
- Task 3: is Harmonic simulation of a 13 bus network, with two sources (generator and utility), 7 loads, 7 transformers, 5 transmission lines and a capacitor.
